This repository provides a small set of iterative optimisation algorithms to illustrate the paper entitled "*Fine-Grained Cooperative Coevolution in a Single Population:  Between Evolution and Swarm~Intelligence*" submitted to the [**Biennial International Conference on Artificial Evolution (EA-2022)**](https://ea2022.inria.fr).
[The paper has been accepted for oral publication](https://ea2022.inria.fr/program.php).
For this scientific paper, we propose two hybridisation schemes between the Fly Algorithm and PSO:

**abstract:** Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) differ in various ways, in particular with respect to %communication schemes
information sharing
and diversity management, making %their performances very diverse with to different scopes of applications.
their scopes of applications very diverse.
Combining the advantages of both approaches is very attractive and has been successfully achieved through hybridisation.
Another possible improvement, notably for addressing scalability issues, is cooperation. It has first been developed for co-evolution in EA techniques and it is now used in PSO. However, until now, attempts to make PSO cooperate have been based on multi-population schemes almost exclusively. The focus of this paper is set on single-population schemes, or fine-grained cooperation. By analogy with an evolutionary scheme that has long been proved effective, the fly algorithm (FA), we design and compare a cooperative PSO (coPSO), and a PSO-flavoured fly algorithm. Experiments run on a benchmark, the Lamp problem, show that fine-grained cooperation based on marginal fitness evaluations and steady-state schemes outperforms classical techniques when the dimension of the problem increases.
These preliminary results highlight interesting future directions of research on fine-grained cooperation schemes, by combining features of PSO and FA.
